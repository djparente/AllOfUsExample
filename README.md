# All of Us Example Files

## Overview

This repository contains example files implementing an analysis of data from the All of Us Research Program.

This repository contains **no data**, only the analysis code. It must be run within the All of Us Researcher Workbench if you want to use it on actual data. You may freely modify or adapt these scripts for your own projects.

I strongly encourage use of the All of Us data to advance biomedical research, and the science of primary care in particular.

## Non-affiliation

I am not affiliated with NIH or the All of Us Research Program (except as a researcher at a participating institution that has been granted access to work with the data).
